## Env

- Using node v10.16.2

- Expo for easier workflow for building => Shipped with a lot  of feature I don't use, but used for easier workflow

## Test

- I tested only reducer TDD way, because I didn't managed to get a good grasp of the jest + react-test-renderer api to unit test pure components

- e2e was out of scope
